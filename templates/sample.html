<title>Sample template</title>

{% if name %}
  <h1>Hello {{ name }}!</h1>
{% else %}
  <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
{% endif %}

<!--
Inside templates you also have access to the config, request, session and g 1 objects as well as the url_for() and
get_flashed_messages() functions.

Automatic escaping is enabled, so if name contains HTML it will be escaped automatically. If you can trust a variable
and you know that it will be safe HTML (for example because it came from a module that converts wiki markup to HTML)
you can mark it as safe by using the Markup class or by using the |safe filter in the template. Head over to the Jinja
2 documentation for more examples.
